# DANG Shell Presentation

Repository of example data and an outline for DANG presentation on being
productive on the command line.

Topics will probably include: shell scripting, piping, for-loops, unix tools
(some subset of of awk, sed, grep, cut, sort, etc.), useful additions (~tmux~
edit: not available on Windows),
and keyboard shortcuts.

## Rebuilding the data

`make_data.sh` is meant to rebuild the data from scratch, but it has not been
tested.

If it actually works, then the following software must be available in your
PATH to run:

-   diamond
-   seqtk
